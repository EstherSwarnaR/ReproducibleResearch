Reproducible Research II: Practices and tools for managing computations and data

Source: http://www.fun-mooc.fr/fr/cours/reproducible-research-ii-practices-and-tools-for-managing-comput/

The imortance of Research artifacts - Data, Code and documentation are to be sensibly stored in **Framework for Reproduction** which involves Data Management Tools. 

For research Github is not the place to archive, rather other archiving servers like arxiv,.. exists. 

Wise choice would be to invest in those Data Management tools that are:
 -> Accessible anytime
 -> Shareable
 -> Losts long 
 -> Specific version of compiled code accessible Computed on that Data
 
Use 'Software Heritage' - not Github to store your data. Github is a great verison management and workflow management tool.
